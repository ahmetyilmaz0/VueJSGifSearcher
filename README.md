# vuejsgifsearcher
### Create an application for searching and displaying gifs.

Application should contain an input field where the user can type in a string based on which gifs will be searched. Searching should start 300ms after the user stops typing into the search input field. Application should contain a component for displaying a set of found gifs. Component displaying gifs should have a pagination feature.
Keep q, offset and limit (viz api doc) parameters in url, so you can easily send the query to your friend and try to create a reusable hook for managing them.
